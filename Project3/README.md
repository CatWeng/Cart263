The World's Most Annoying blog

*This project needs sound on*
The World's Most annoying blog was inspired by the desire to create something humorous using random generation. Originally, I wanted to work off the "text-based Youtube" prompt. Instead, creating a very literal and sarcastic text based blog (where my "this is a ____" text came from) but I felt the idea didn't have enough complexity to it. Hazel then suggested a recipe blog, and the idea was born. The evolution to The World's Most Annoying Blog came naturally as bloggers are one of the most annoying internet presences in the world. Recipe bloggers are the bane of any aspiring or casual cook's existence. To get to the important part, one is forced to wade through paragraphs upon paragraphs of endless rambling about weather, family, fashion, and the occasional product sponsorship along with 3000 aesthetic photos of the food before getting to the recipe.nIf you're an avid follower of the blogger, sure, it's a nice little peek in to their daily lives. If not, it's just maddening. The rest of us are hungry and just want to cook the "quickest and tastiest veggie pasta in the world I SWEAR". It feels like digging through the mess of a blog takes even longer than the cooking process itself. Anyways, I found a blog that contained all of these common blogger tropes and used that as a base for my project.
All credit goes to acozykitchen.com for the text used. While I'm sure the blog owner is a lovely person her blog is the exact type that I'd rather eat a [insert something unappetizing here] than use, out of principle.

My project is a self-aware parody of these types of recipe blogs. My project incorporate scode from several sources including w3schools, a flickr API demo, class examples and thepolyglotdeveloper. The two libraries I included are rita and responsive voice to achieve peak irritation. I used rita for the markov chain to generate sentences from a file containing the text data. When the user scrolls down, a new "blog post" is created by generating a random word. That word is used to grab a related photo from Flickr and inserted into the title with a randomly chosen adjective and dish eg. "amazing apple pie". Along with the markov generated text, you get a whole blog post. The blog also prompts a subscription box (Don't forget to like, subscribe and follow!) every few seconds, interrupting your pleasant blog-browsing experience and causing all around frustration. Several blog features are "locked" behind a premium subscriber paywall, another irksome feature some have adopted with the rise of services like Patreon. I used responsive voice to have the page read out any text the mouse hovers over. Totally unnecessary, highly bothersome and funny to hear the robotic voice butchering words. The font choices and page design as well, reflect the design choices of bloggers trying to be cute and quirky but all they did was make their posts hard to read. I would have liked to expand on this project more by adding other annoying blog things (functional ads for one) but I believe I achieved my project goal- a very annoying blog.
